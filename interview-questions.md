# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
<!-- comment test -->
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: Virtual DOM is the virtual representation (or idea) of the code created.

Researched answer: Virtual DOM is the lightweight Javascript programming concept where representation of the UI code created is stored and synced with with the real or visual DOM.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return in Ruby means there's no need to use commands such as "return" that are required in languages like JavaScript in order to ensure the value/action of the previous line will be executed; the line will return automatically in Ruby.

Researched answer: Ruby having an implicit return means the need to use the "return" keyword to return a value is not necessary.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences? 

Your answer:
Differences: JavaScript has explicit return vs Ruby being implicit; in JS you have to type "return" to get the value of the previous line, in Ruby you don't. JavaScript is for front-end coding, Ruby is used for back-end. JavaScript has type coercion (when a data type is converted to a different one), Ruby does not it.

Common: Both JavaScript are dynamic languages, they both are/can be object oriented (Object-Oreiented Programming), and both are scripting languages.


Researched answer: Both JavaScript and Ruby are multi-paradigm, dynamically-typed languages. Both support the creation of objects that can be manipulated by programmers, and are interpreted.

While Ruby is for backend development only, JavaScript can be used for both frontend and backend development. JavaScript runs must faster than Ruby in certain cases, and is more scalable than Ruby due to Node.JS.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: A version manager is a system application that handles changes to a computer program. Changes can include documentation, updates, patches/fixes, etc.

Researched answer: In software development, version manager is the practice of tracking changes made to software codes. 

(not sure of which one we should be referring to, conflict between me being Desktop Support and future programmer)

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: (Ruby-Specification); a computer domain-specific language used to test code in Ruby.

2. Test-driven development:the practice of emphasizing the writing and creation of test coding before the writing of the actual code.

3. CRUD: acronym that stands for "Create, Read, Update, and Delete" - the four basic actions performed on data and are essential for creating and managing data elements.
